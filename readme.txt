== Description ==

Mailcoach is an email marketing platform that covers all your email needs for a fraction of the cost. Don't pay for your subscribers, pay for what you send.

This plugin allows admins to create a subscribe form to a mailcoach email list. This can be plugged into your website with a shortcode.
