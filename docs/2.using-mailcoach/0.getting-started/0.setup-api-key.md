title: Setup API token
---

## Getting started

Before we can proceed, we need an API Token and Mailcoach URL. You can find this information in the settings of your Mailcoach profile on your Mailcoach instance.

1. Log in to your Mailcoach instance and access your Mailcoach profile settings.
2. Create a new API Token.
3. In your WordPress Admin panel, navigate to Mailcoach settings and enter the API Token and Mailcoach URL.
4. Save the settings.
5. You should be able to view all your email lists with the number of subscribers. If no lists are displayed, make sure you create a list on your Mailcoach instance first.
