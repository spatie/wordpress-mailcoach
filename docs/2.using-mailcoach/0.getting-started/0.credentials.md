Before we can proceed, you'll need an API Token and the Mailcoach URL, which can be obtained from your Mailcoach profile settings.

2. Create a new API Token.
3. In your WordPress Admin panel, navigate to Mailcoach settings and enter the API Token and Mailcoach URL.
4. Save the settings.
5. You should be able to view all your email lists with the number of subscribers. If no lists are displayed, make sure you create a list on your Mailcoach instance first.
