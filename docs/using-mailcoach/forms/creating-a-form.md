Now let's move on to the core functionality of the plugin. Navigate to the "Forms" or "Add Form" section in the WordPress Admin panel.

You can easily design and customize a form with your own HTML to seamlessly integrate with your website's look and feel.

You may encounter a warning regarding the "Email List" with the message "External form subscriptions are not enabled for this list. Please enable them in the Mailcoach dashboard."
To enable external form subscriptions, go to the email list settings on your Mailcoach instance.
Access the "Onboarding" tab and enable the option "Allow POST from an external form." Don't forget to save.

After saving the form, you will notice a shortcode field that cannot be updated. Copy the shortcode for later use.

You also have the option to customize the messages displayed to the user after they attempt to subscribe.
